Cinema Room REST Service is a hard project for the Spring Security for Java Backend Developers.
</p>



<h2>About</h2>
Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? The idea of a ticket booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
In this project, you will create a simple Spring REST service that will help you manage a small movie theater. It will handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services, and respond with JSON objects.
